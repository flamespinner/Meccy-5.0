# Meccy-5.0
Revival of FRC Team 3926's Original test robot platform Meccy

Meccy started as an offseason robotics project in a small electrical box with non FRC components.

Over the years Meccy grew into a full mecanum drive base with the 2012 FRC Control system. Used primarly for outreach and demo bots.

Introducing Meccy 5.0. A mecanum drive base robot much smaller then their father sporting a full 2022 control system and the ability to see!
